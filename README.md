This program has:
• You will implement one of the following scheduling algorithms (just
simulation) with any programming language.
• GUI is a must and has a big part of the score (Gantt Chart must be
provided).
• Number of processes should be user defined (i.e. user enters them at run
time).
• All process data (i.e. process arrival time, burst time) must be user defined.
• Validation for the input data must be considered (i.e. can’t enter negative
numbers, or characters in the input fields).
• Waiting Time, Turnaround Time, and Response Time for each process should
be calculated.
• Average Waiting Time, Average Turnaround Time, and Average Response
Time should be calculated.
